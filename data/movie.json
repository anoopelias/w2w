On the verge of defeat, the forces defending mankind have no choice but to turn to two unlikely heroes—a washed-up former pilot (Charlie Hunnam) and an untested trainee (Rinko Kikuchi)—who are teamed to drive a legendary but seemingly obsolete Jaeger from the past.

Two years earlier, her fiancé Manech left for the front at the Somme. Like millions of others he was \"killed on the field of battle.\" It's written in black and white on the official notice. But Mathilde refuses to believe it. If Manech had died, she would know. She hangs on to her intuition as tightly as she would onto the last thread of hope linking her to her lover. A former sergeant tells her in vain that Manech died in the no man's land of a trench named Bingo Crepescule, in the company of four other men condemned to die for self-inflicted wounds. Her path ahead is full of obstacles but Mathilde is not frightened. Anything is possible to someone who is willing to challenge fate...","title":"A Very Long Engagement","language":"fr","image":"https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/jtE7Xrj8KKnhGI3p2yCgwrtUCnd.jpg","popularity":23.05451,"genre":[{"id":18,"name":"Drama"}],"productionCompany":[{"id":975,"name":"Gerber Pictures"},{"id":1232,"name":"2003 Productions"},{"id":3823,"name":"TF1 Films Production"},{"id":5358,"name":"Canal+"},{"id":6194,"name":"Warner Bros."},{"id":11246,"name":"Région Ile-de-France"},{"id":12000,"name":"Tapioca Films"},{"id":18367,"name":"Centre National de la Cinématographie (CNC)"},{"id":20346,"name":"Région Bretagne"},{"id":76911,"name":"Région Poitou-Charentes"}],"_class":"com.w2w.What2Watch.models.Movie"}

Instead of going to Vietnam, Wordsworth goes off to fight against the French while Coleridge stays at home and promotes utopianism. After the war, the poets live and work together with Coleridge's wife, Sara (Samantha Morton), and Wordsworth's sister, Dorothy (Emily Woof). At first this communal arrangement works to the advantage of Coleridge--who does some of his best writing while Wordsworth stagnates--until Coleridge becomes addicted to opium. Wordsworth, meanwhile, doesn't find his voice until he abandons his friend. In 20th-century vernacular, Wordsworth is the yuppie, Coleridge the hippie.","title":"Pandaemonium","language":"en","image":"https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/dO7wct6RAdDKEaQrA9IYD4BsKJL.jpg","popularity":0.165367,"genre":[{"id":18,"name":"Drama"},{"id":10769,"name":"Foreign"}],"productionCompany":[{"id":718,"name":"Arts Council of England"}],"_class":"com.w2w.What2Watch.models.Movie"}
